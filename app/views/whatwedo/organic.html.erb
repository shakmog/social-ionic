              The concept of Business Plan writing at Rendzina Capital is one which has evolved over the years into an
organic piece of organizational Strategy that allows entrepreneurs and their organizations make
informed decisions while adapting to changes along the way. </p>
<p>
We engage our consultants on different components of the
Business Plan document to ensure the outcome is a product of
individual and collective expertise. We take the concept of the
Business plan beyond a managerial document for executives to
delibrate upon; our infusion of Street Sense adaptation makes it a
viable and effective working tool for entrepreneurs who are
dynamic having their focus on congruent results.
            </p>

          <h4 class="design">Why Organic?</h4>
          <p>
Over the years, the world has become a largely unpredictable economic environment. The forces of
Industrialization, globalization, technology disruptions and innovations, political chaos, market
stratification and changes in population demographics have a very formidable impact on the results and
experiences of businesses and organizations.
To combat this uncertainty that pervades the global business environment, Rendzina Capital has come
up with the principle and practice of developing Organic Business Plans.

<p>
  Organic Business Plans are created to take on adjustments
and adaptations along the way. They are created to absorb
and interpret current situations creatively and places
responsibility on the owner/managers or executives to take
action based on accurate and current data available.

entrepreneurs and their organizations adapt dynamic
processes with applicable to enjoy sustainable results.

Business plan is outdated, overly complex and unnecessary. Rendzina Capital helps organizations and

business idea but you also get a convenient way to test, tweak and modify the business model, in other
words, you find out what works and what doesnâ€™t, ultimately creating a business that works.

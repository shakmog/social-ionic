							 <%= image_tag "consulting", align: "left" %> <p>&nbsp;Today's entrepreneur is faced with multiple challenges caused by globalization, competition, diversification, emerging trends, commercialization etc. the need for specialized knowledge and systematic assistance is on the increase in the business world for companies whether great or small to be effective and remain competitive.</p>

	 <p>Wise organizations and governments therefore employ the advantage of professional consulting to satisfactorily meet this need.</p>

	 <p>Power in organizations and progress in governments now rests to a greater degree than ever before with knowledge workers, the world has become knowledge-driven and those who possess the knowledge vital to organizationâ€™s competitive future must become sought after.</p>

	 <p>Governments need more than ever before to develop means of managing, retaining, understanding and maximizing the power of the knowledge that lies within their systems of engagement.</p>

	 <h4 class="design">Business Process Management</h4>

	 <p>Business process management (BPM) is a holistic management approach to aligning an organization's business processes with the wants and needs of clients. It promotes business effectiveness and efficiency while striving for innovation, flexibility, and integration with technology. Our BPM service attempts to improve processes continuously. It can therefore be described as a "process optimization process." We argue that BPM enables organizations to be more efficient, more effective and more capable of change than a functionally focused, traditional hierarchical management approach. Our BPM services help organizations to gain higher customer satisfaction, product quality, delivery speed and time-to-market speed.</p>

	 <h4 class="design">Strategic Management</h4>

	 <p>We deploy the force of Strategic management thinking into businesses to analyze the major initiatives taken by a company's top management on behalf of owners, involving resources and performance in external environments. It entails specifying the organization's mission, vision and objectives, developing policies and plans, often in terms of projects and programs, which are designed to achieve these objectives, and then allocating resources to implement the policies and plans, projects and programs. We often use a balanced scorecard to evaluate the overall performance of the business and its progress towards objectives. Taking your organization through our strategic management advisory always leads us to that set of managerial decisions and actions that determine the long term performance of a business enterprise. Our experts can help define and understand market drivers, innovative value propositions, risks, technology strategies and the development of new business models.

	 <h4 class="design">Productivity Management</h4>

	 <p>We pride ourselves in knowing that we are one of the foremost organizations rendering Productivity Management as a service, we refer to it as the systematic recording and critical examination of existing and proposed ways of doing work, as a means of developing and applying easier and more effective methods and reducing costs.â€Ž Work measurement is the application of techniques designed to establish the time for a qualified worker to carry out a specified job at a defined level of performance. We live in a challenging environment with infrastructural decay and some level of economic anomalies which weigh down on the productivity of the workers and cause their skill level to diminish. We therefore attempt to level the international rating of effectiveness in certain positions and functions with the present challenges faced in our socio-economic environment and dig out an efficient solution to manage the productivity of workers. If the standard rating is maintained and the appropriate system is employed, a worker will achieve standard performance over the working day or shift. We argue that if productivity is low within our organizations, the nation can neither improve its standard of living locally nor compete globally. The productivity growth of organizations affect wage negotiations, exchange rates and a host of other economic, political and social conditions.</p>

	 <h4 class="design">Entrepreneurship Development</h4>

	 <p>At Rendzina Capital, weâ€™ve developed a faculty for organizing Entrepreneurship Development Programs to respond to the need of the nation and develop expertise and skills for potential learners to become job creators rather than job seekers. Our programs have been designed to develop, motivate & assist learners for setting up new enterprises and manage them successfully. We provide management training coupled with Entrepreneurship-oriented coaching in business strategy, finance, organizational design, supply chain, and other areas. Our coaching is aimed at providing the necessary skills for entrepreneurs to address short term tactical issues while planning long term strategies for their organizations. These two aspects of start-ups often require different mindsets and skill sets, which can lead to issues where one is focused on over the other. A large part of being a successful entrepreneur is being able to develop ideas, to evaluate them critically, and to sustain those ideas in the face of adversity from other people, environment or institutions. Rendzina Capital understands the need of the hour and our programs provide strategic behaviour, leadership, and individual psychological analysis of the forces that work against entrepreneurs specifically and countermeasures for these forces. We also discuss means of sustaining vision and ideas, both from a science derived perspective and from accounts of other entrepreneurs.</p>

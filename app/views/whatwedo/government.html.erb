              Today’s service-based economy is fundamentally dependent on IT. Through
  these computer-based systems, the critical interactions at the heart of service
  delivery are defined, managed, recorded, and governed.
  Furthermore, in recent years, IT systems have moved from being hidden back office solutions used to
  process the mountains of human-maintained paperwork, to being directly exposed to users of those
  services through front office applications accessed through Internet browsers, mobile apps, and the
  growing plethora of tablets and Internet-enabled devices.
  This digitization of service delivery has been one of the most rapid and compelling trends of the past
  two decades, and has spurred a revolution in how to most effectively bring transactional solutions to
  end users.</p>

<p>
  Public sector agencies across the world are attempting to transition from closed, top-down,
bureaucratic, and paper-based transactional models towards online, integrated digital services that
encourage a new kind of interaction between citizens and the state. This journey towards digital public
service management appears to be reaching a critical point where the confluence of citizen demand for
greater speed and more transparency in service delivery
is being met with an increased appetite within the public
sector to deliver services in more innovative ways
through the use of open technologies, a diversity of
delivery agents (including the increased involvement of
smaller companies), and more agile delivery practices
that help to demonstrate meaningful progress earlier in a
project’s lifecycle.
